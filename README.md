*YABI* is Yet Another Basic Interpolator (sorry, still a bad name). It is designed simply to interpolate between points, over time, on one or more control 'channels'. Think fading between colors in an array of LEDs or repositioning a servo. It is the BOTTOM of the stack, and is designed to sit directly above the hardware.

If you'd like, say, some sort of _animation framework_, have a look at *BAF* [1], which I wrote as a higher level companion.

Remember, perfect is the enemy of good enough.

### Future Features
* Non-linear interpolation
* An optimistic outlook on life
